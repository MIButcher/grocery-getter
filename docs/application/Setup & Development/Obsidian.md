Obsidian is a 3rd party application that makes managing documentation in markdown extremely convenient. Visual Studio has a markdown visualizer built in so Obsidian isn't required, however its missing some features/niceties like cross linking that makes it easier to create and use documentation.

Obsidian can be found here: https://obsidian.md/

To use open the `docs` folder as your vault.
