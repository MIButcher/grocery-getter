## Context / Problem Statement

We need a consistent plan for adding features to the base application template in order to not bloat future applications based off of the starter. We also need a consistent way to pass on recommended plugins to handle various feature needs.

## Decision Outcome

In order to be included in the base template the feature must be foundational to the use of the application. Things like: package management, api generation, etc.

Other recommended plugins will be documented in the `docs/Recommended Plugins/` folder. This documentation should include:
- What the plugin does
- Where to find documentation
- Instructions *(or link)* on installation and usage
